## Showcasing my journey in learning AI technology.....

## Project-1:-
`chatbox.py` : A python code which for chatbox providing repsonse using predefined answers made using concepts of python dictionaries.

## Project-2:-
`A12.py` : A python code file containg code to find the superhero by user input by using concept of  logistic
regression

###Setup:
##### 1.File Setup
The CSV data is created with various superhero attributes.

These attributes include strength, intelligence, speed, agility, and durability.

#### 2. Model Training:

A logistic regression model is trained using the superhero dataset.

StandardScaler is used to scale the feature values.

After training, the model's accuracy is calculated and printed.



#### 3. User Input:

Users can input their own attributes, which are then used to predict the closest superhero match.

Please provide suggestions for further development of code
