## Showcasing my journey in learning AI technology.....

## Project-1:-
`chatbox.py` : A python code which for chatbox providing repsonse using predefined answers made using concepts of python dictionaries.

## Project-2:-
`A12.py` : A python code file containg code to find the superhero by user input by using concept of  logistic
regression

##### 1.File Setup
The CSV data is created with various superhero attributes.

These attributes include strength, intelligence, speed, agility, and durability.

#### 2. Model Training:

A logistic regression model is trained using the superhero dataset.

StandardScaler is used to scale the feature values.

After training, the model's accuracy is calculated and printed.



#### 3. User Input:

Users can input their own attributes, which are then used to predict the closest superhero match.

Please provide suggestions for further development of code

## Project-3:-
`GCS.py`: A simple AI application that provides short responses based on the sentiment of user input. This project uses Tkinter for the GUI and TextBlob for sentiment analysis.

### FEATURES:-
- Analyzes the sentiment of user input text.
- Provides short responses such as emojis and words based on the sentiment.
- Detects common phrases indicating the end of a conversation and responds with "bye".
- Provides an immersive feel of communicating with a girl.

### Usage

1. Enter a paragraph in the text box.
2. Click the "Submit" button.
3. The application will analyze the sentiment of the input and display a short response almost replicating messageing style of a girl.
